Design:

1. Get the coordinates of the first point of line1
	1.1 Declare a and b for x and y of the first point as type float
	1.2 Ask the user to input the x and y of the first point of line1
	1.3 Input the values the user entered into variables a and b


2. Get the coordinates of the second point of line1
	2.1 Declare c and d for the x and y of the second point as type float
	2.2 Ask the user to input the x and y of the first point of line1
	2.3 Input the values the user entered into variables c and d


3. Get the coordinates of the first point of line2
	3.1 Declare e and f for the x and y of the first point as type float
	3.2 Ask the user to input the x and y of the fist point of line2
	3.3 Input the values the user entered into variables e and f


4. Get the coordinates of the second point of line2
	4.1 Declare g and h for the x and y of the second point as type float
	4.2 Ask the user to input x and y of the second point of line2
	4.3 Input the values the user entered into variables g and h


5. Ouput the coordinates and equations of the two lines
	5.1 Output the coordinates of line1
	5.2 Output the equation of line1
	5.3 Output the coordinates of line2
	5.4 Output the equation of line2


6. Check to see whether or not the lines are similar, parallel, or neither
	6.1 Check to see if the slopes of the lines match.
	6.2 If the slopes match, check to see if the y-intercepts match as well, and if so tell the user that the lines they entered are the same
	6.3 Tell the user that the lines they have entered are parallel if the slopes match but the y-intercepts do not
	6.4 Continue the calculation and output of the intersection if the lines are not similar or parallel 


7. Calculate and output the point of intersection (if the lines are not similar or parallel)
	7.1 Put in variables into equation of slope to calculate slope
	7.2 Put in variables into the y-intercept equation to calculate the y-intercept
	7.3 Put in variables into the "x coordinate of intersection" equation to calculate the x coordinate of the point of intersection
	7.4 Put in varaibles into the "y coordinate of intersection" equation to calculate the y coordinate of the point of intersection
	7.5 Output the coordinates for the point of intersection 


8. Draw the two lines and their intersection
	8.1 Call the graphics.h library
	8.2 Use window statement from graphics library to create a window
	8.3 Use statement: line (x1, y1, x2, y2); to draw line1 by replacing the x and y variables by a,b,c,d
	8.4 Use statement: line (x1, y1, x2, y2); to draw line2 by replacing the x and y variables by e,f,g,h
	8.5 Use statement: circle (x, y, radius); to draw a circle at the point of intersection
