1. When you input the points of two lines with similar slopes you will get the following:
	Point of intersection = (1.#QNAN, 1.#QNAN)


2. When you enter the points of a vertical line, you will get the following (considering line1 is the vertical line):
	Equation of Line 1:  y = 1.#INF x + -1.#INF
	Point of intersection = (1.#QNAN, 1.#QNAN)


3. If you enter zero's for all of the variables, you will get the following output:

	****Intersection Calculator****

	Enter the x and y of the first point on line1: 0 0
	Enter the x and y of the second point on line1: 0 0

	Enter the x and y of the first point on line2: 0 0
	Enter the x and y of the second point on line2: 0 0

	Line 1:  (0, 0)  and (0, 0)
	Equation of Line 1:  y = -1.#IND x + -1.#IND

	Line 2:  (0, 0)  and (0, 0)
	Equation of Line 2:  y = -1.#IND x + -1.#IND

	Point of intersection = (1.#QNAN, 1.#QNAN)
