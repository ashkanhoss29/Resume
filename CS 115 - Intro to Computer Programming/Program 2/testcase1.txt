Working through a problem

You should choose whatever numbers you want to fill in these blanks.
x1 = 1	y1 = 1
x2 = 5 	y2 = 5
x3 = 0 	y3 = 6
x4 = 6 	y4 = 0

Use a calculator as needed

Slope and y-intercept of line 1
Slope = 1
y-intercept = 0

Slope and y-intercept of line 2
Slope = -1
y-intercept = 6

Intersection point = (3, 3)
