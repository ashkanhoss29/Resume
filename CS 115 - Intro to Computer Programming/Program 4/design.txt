Design:


1. Get user input for different values:
	1.1 Get users input for a number between 0 and 36
		1.1.1 Variable type int to store value
		1.1.2 Function to get users input
		1.1.3 Use of if statement to check whether user entered correct type of input
	1.2 Get users input for their wager
		1.2.1 Variable type float for user to be able to enter cents
		1.2.2 Function to get users input
		1.2.3 If statement to check to see whether or not user entered correct value based on how much they have 
	1.3 Get the choice of the user for three choices
		1.3.1 Variable type char to store users input as character
		1.3.2 Function that will accept different characters (example E, R, or H)
		1.3.3 Check to see whether user input correct character based on which choice is being presented to them


2. Get random number for ball spin:
	2.1 Variable type int to store value of randomly generated number
	2.2 Function to generate a random number between 0 and 36
	2.3 Generate random number based on time for best results

3. Simulate spin
	3.1 Function to display spin:
	3.2 Create delay for output to console for added suspense and realism
	3.3 Draw an animation
		3.3.1 Draw a circle representing the ball
		3.3.2 Use a loop to add to the circles coordinate each time loop runs
		3.3.4 Delay each loop by a number of seconds so graphics will animate

4. Calculate winnings:
	4.1 Variables type float to store winnings. Float so winnings can be stored with cent values
	4.2 Function to calculate winnings based on what user inputs for the four different variables
	4.3 Check to see whether randomly generate variables match users inputs
	4.4 Add or subtract winnings to total. Variable total type float for cent values
	4.5 Output to the user their winnings after added to stake

5. Check to see whether or not player can continue, and if so if they want to play again or quite
	5.1 Variable stake to store how much user has at the beginning and end of main() function
	5.2 Create loop in main() to be able to rerun program
	5.3 At the end of loop check to see whether or not user has any money.  If not end loop.
	5.4 If user has enough money, ask them if they want to play again or quite
