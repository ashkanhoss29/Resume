Design:


1. Have user input values for speed and angle in degrees:
	1.1 Declare variables for speed and angle as type float
	1.2 Get user to input value for speed
	1.3 Get user to input value for angle in degrees
	1.4 Input values into proper variables


2. Convert degrees to radians:
	2.1 Declare variable for radians
	2.2 Create function with convertion equation
	2.3 Input variable for degrees into conversion function
	2.4 Input converted value into variable for radians


3. Output to the user the values for speed and angle:
	3.1 Output speed
	3.2 Output angle in degrees
	3.3 Output angle in radians


4. Calculate max distance:
	4.1 Declare variables for max distances of each planet/moon
	4.2 Declare and set constants for gravitational constants
	4.3 Create function with equation for calculation
	4.4 Input variables for speed, angle in radians, and gravitational constant for each planet/moon into function for each planet/moon


5. Calculate max height:
	5.1 Declare variables for max height of each planet/moon
	5.2 Create function with equation for calculation
	5.3 Input variables for speed, angle in radians, gravitational constant, and half distance into function for each planet/moon


6. Output to the user the results of distance and height calculations and which is the largest distance and height:
	6.1 Output to the user the max distance and height for each planet/moon
	6.2 Create function that will use if statements to decide which distance and height value is largest
	6.3 Output the results the function returns to the user


7. Output to the user 5 points on the trajectory of each planet/moon:
	7.1 Creat a function that will calculate and output 5 points on a trajectory
	7.2 Input values into this function for each individual planet/moon
	7.3 For each planet/moon, output the 5 points on its trajectory


8. Draw the trajectories:
	8.1 Create a function that will convert meters to pixels
	8.2 Draw four lines between the points of each trajectory
	8.3 Draw a small circle in the locatoin of the points
	8.3 Set each planet/moon to its own color
	8.4 Draw the names of each planet/moon with its own color
