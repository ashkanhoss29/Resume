Design:

1.  Create function to get 16 strings and randomly swap those strings
	1.1  Declare string array with 16 positions
	1.2  Get eight strings from a text file
		1.2.1  Have user enter the name of file
		1.2.2  Open file with the name the user input
		1.2.3  Read in eight strings and input them in 8 positions of string array
		1.2.4  Close file
	1.3  Duplicate eight strings read in to other positions of the string 
             array so you have two sets of the same eight strings
	1.4  Generate random numbers 0 to 15 and use them for array 
             positions to randomly swap strings of string array


2.  Create a function to get the user to input a valid number 
	2.1  Declare an integer variable to store users input
	2.2  Tell the user to input a number between 1 and 16
	2.3  Store the users input number into integer variable
	2.4  Use if statement to check whether user entered valid number


3.  Compare two inputs from user and count how many turns user took
	3.1  Call function from step 2 to get number from user twice
	3.2  Use if statement to determine whether or not 
	     the string at a given position should be output
	     positions are the same or not
	3.3  Declare a bool array to keep track of what strings should be output
		3.3.1  If for the current turn the user has chosen a number, make the position
		       of the bool array true
		3.3.2  If the strings match keep the bool array at 
                       that position true, otherwise return to false


4.  Output to the console a grid that shows the "cards"
	4.1  Create a function to output the top and bottom of grid
	4.2  Create a function to output the rest of the grid, with 4 rows and 4 columns
		4.2.1  Loop to determine which row should be output
		4.2.2  Loop inside the other to determine which column in the row should be output
		4.2.3  If statement to determine whether or not the number or string should be output
			4.2.3.1  If the bool array is false, display number
			4.2.3.2  If the bool array is true, display the string
