cs541 - Compiler Design
Ashkan Hosseini

This program adds Code Generation to the HW4 program.
Code Generation will generate code based on the input CSX program.
The code generated is Java byte code.

-- Files --
  README - this file.
  Maefile - make file for building and testing the program.
  test.csx - the test CSX program
  csx.cup - The cup file that describes how CUP should build the parser.
  csx.jlex - The jlex file that describes how JLEX should build the scanner.
  Scanner.java - Uses generated scanner to feed parser.
  ast.java - Specifies nodes in the AST. Used by csx.cup to build AST.
           - Contains checkTypes() methods and other type checking tools.
           - Contains cg() methods and other Code Generation tools.
  SymbolTable.java - a symbol table used by ast.java to keep track of
                     declared variables and their types and kinds.
  Symb.java - basic unit used by SymbolTable; contains variable name.
  SymbolTable.java - subclass of Symb.java; adds Kinds and Type information
                   - contains variable index info for Code Generation
  SymbolTableMethod.java - subclass of SymbolInfo; adds method parm info
  Kinds.java - list of allowable kinds in a CSX program
  Types.java - list of allowable types in a CSX program
  DuplicateException.java - used by SymbolTable to indicate duplicate entry
  EmptySTException.java - used by SymbolTable to indicate no scope access
  P5.java - driver; scans, parses, type checks, and generates code for test file

  -- For more specific implementation specifics, please check individual files --

  -- KNOWN NOT WORKING --
  Most type check errors from proj4
  Arrays
  Nested while loops
