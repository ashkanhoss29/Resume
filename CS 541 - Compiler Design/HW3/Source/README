cs541 - Compiler Design
Ashkan Hosseini

This program uses CUP to build a parser for the CSX langauge.
An Abstract Syntax Tree is built using the parser and the program
  is reconstructed and output to show correct parse.

-- Files --
  README - this file
  Makefile - make file for building and testing the program
  test.csx - test file used by Make to test the program
  csx.cup - The cup file that describes how CUP should build the parser
  csx.jlex - The JLEX file from Program 2 that is used to build the scanner
  Scanner.java - Uses generated scanner to feed parser
  ast.java - Specifies nodes in the AST. Used by csx.cup to build AST
  
-- Building --
To build the program, use the 'make' command

-- Running --
Write a test program into test.csx file and run 'make test'
An Abstract Syntax Tree of the test program is built
After the AST is built, the test program is reconstructed and output

-- Please check files and  CSX langauge specs for more implementation details --
