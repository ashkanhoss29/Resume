cs541 - Compiler Design
Ashkan Hosseini

This program is a scanner for the CSX programming language.
It uses JLex to generate the scanner.

-- Files --
  README - this file
  Makefile - make file for building and testing the pgoram
  tiny.csx - test file used by Make to test the scanner
  P2.java - driver that reads the test file and outputs tokens
  csx.jlex - JLex file that is used to generate the scanner
  sym.java - contains symbol constants for mapping tokens

-- Building --
To build the scanner program, use the 'make' command.

-- Running --
Write a CSX file named tiny.csx and use the 'make test' command.
This will read the file and output token information with associated
 line and column numbers.

-- Please check the internal documenation and csx.jlex file for details --
